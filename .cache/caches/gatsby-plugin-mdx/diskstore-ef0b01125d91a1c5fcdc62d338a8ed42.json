It's\na really good practice to keep your imports at the top.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`once you've imported random let's use it to get a random number from 0 to 1. So in programming varaibles have a `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`type`}</em>{`, python makes\nlife easier because you don't need to say what type you want you just make a variable name and it gives you what you want.
