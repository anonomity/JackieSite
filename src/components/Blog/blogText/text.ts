export const text1 = `My first blog series is dedicated so I can keep track of my progress with learning some fundamentals to javascript and nodejs that I've pushed to the side for too \n
bellow I will include the current list of words I want to dive into deeper:

export const text12 =  `I know what you're probably thinking: 'omg ur a noob', and yes you may be right. Of course some of these concepts I do understand, 
but not fully, I know that there are some hidden corners of the words that I have yet to investigate, other words I have a jumbled understanding of and I need to 
do some serious maintenance work and weed out the discrepencies, anyways I hope these post can help those who know humility enought to ask the same questions and 
seek the answers. Enjoy and buckle up, the journey ahead will not be simple.`

So currently while creating these blog posts I'm trying to do it in the most efficient matter <obviously> and I'm starting to rethink my life, So right now I'm at the point 
where I feel fairly confident in my React skills, my so called base, I know Javascript should be my base but for the time being, its sufficient. Due to my newfound confidence In my React skills, 
I believe it's time to branch out, and work on different methods for creating React applications, other than create-react-app. When browsing, about what tech stack to use when creating
efficient blog post application I kept being led to Gatsby. I knew sooner or later I would use this technology, now with a goal in mind I'm starting to feel excited. It's always exciting for
me to learn new technologies for developing software and so far I'm enjoying this little documentation here of my journey, in retrospect, I think it's a pitty I didn't document the steps
which led me to this spot more thoroughly, you take for granted the mountains you've climbed and the diversities faced. Anyways, I know the journey is not over and there is a lot ahead,
hopefully someone benefits from this mumbo jumbo.
