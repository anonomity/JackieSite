# Regret but not fully

So I'm in the middle of development for an app I plan on releasing soon. This started making me think about all the things that could go wrong when people
start using this application. I implemented a REST React-Native application that using firebase as the database. When I started researching about offline capabilities
I found that firebase ships its product with solutions to making your application offline friendly right off the bat 😁 great, eh? No... Because I made my
application REST, so the app makes requests to a server, it basically looses all those offline features 🤦‍♀️.. But okay let's not be all negative, the _good_ thing
about REST is that, let say for my mobile app, I don't use the server functions but I just put the firebase functions directly into my Client code, I plan on
making a website as well so the user can sync data across all devices, so I can still use that backend code for the website.
