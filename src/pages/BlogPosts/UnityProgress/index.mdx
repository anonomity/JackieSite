## My Gamer Past
Hello Everyone! I'm very excited to start this devlog. Like most programmers, I played a lot of video games when I was younger.
Mario, Zelda, Crash Bandecoot, Runescape, and so so many more. I've always kept it a the back of my mind that I would love to develop
games. Now I want to document the process of my Game Dev journey. I've messed around with Unity in the past and I really enjoyed it,
C# is not such a difficult language, thankfully for me transitioning from Typescipt isn't as painful as it would be if I were 
transitioning from Javascript. 

## Mario and 2D
For my first project I want to build Mario, this was a game that I really loved when I was little, playing on my gameboy and I think
it shouldn't be so hard. Also before when I was playing around with Unity, it was with 3D games so now I think maybe 2D will be
a good starting point, but I'll definitly be getting to 3D in the future.
