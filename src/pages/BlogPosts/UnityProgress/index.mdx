## Hypatia 
Hello Everyone, I'm a programmer who loves video games and as of March 2021 I started making my own games and learning Unity. What is Hypatia you might ask? Well it's a game I've been working on since May 2021
and its a 2D action rpg, made with pixel art. Some features it includes is Greek Mythology, Ancient Athens, and skill trees, and philosophy. I want to make an exciting game that
users will have fun playing, but I also want people to learn along the way, that's why I'm making the game very accurate and drawing the scenes based on what it really looked like. 
I visited Athens, Greece in June 2021 and got a first hand look at what I'm dealing with. The Acropolis Museum helped me tremendously with creating models of the city at different points of time.
Although accuracy is very important to me, I have to twist the truth a bit to keep things interesting, thats why you might find some philosophers walking the same street that are from somewhat 
different generations! As of now I'm developing the art, programming and music all by myself but who knows what will change!

## Unity 
Some concepts I've ran into while learning unity, before this projects I haven't had too much experience with statically typed languages, I used mostly javascript and python, though I 
had one class in University on Java.


- Scriptable Objects
- Event System
- Singleton design pattern
- Vectors 
- System.Action

**Delegate** : is a type that represents references to methods with a particular parameter list and return type.
- Delegates are used to pass methods as arguments to other methods.
- like arrow functions 


as a sidenote I've realized I had to stop using arrays as much in c# because Lists are the superior data structure.

## Scriptable Objects
- Smart data containers that can hold values that also exist outside of play mode
- Globally accessible and scene independent
- Act as layers to expose and reuse common functionalities
- you can edit scriptable objects while in playmode
- Using Scriptable Object as Enum States


<img src={compare} alt="difference between scriptable vs mono" />  

so the only new methode you get is OnDestoy() and you don't have access to the game loop through functions like
update and start

### Scriptable Objects Vs Monobehaviors
Scriptable objects can not be attached to components as a gameobject instead they are created a project asset 
files



Monobehaviors are always live on a game object, so by design their bound to an instance of a gameobject
and because of that when you want to access the data for the prefab, each instance will have a copy of the transform
and the gameobject which is a waste of space. 
- moral of the story, if you prefab doesn't need access to gameobject or transform, and you want to save
memory, you should use Scriptable Objects instead of Monobehaviors

### Uses 

- using a scriptable object as an event relayer that listens to unity's input system so that events can subscribe to it whenever
 the input is detected so that you don't need to keep program different listeners.

## Namespace

namespaces are like containers for classes, their purpose is to organize scrips and avoid conflics between scripts. My rudementary understanding is that namespaces are just 
more powerful classes that make it much easier to access operators within the object.
