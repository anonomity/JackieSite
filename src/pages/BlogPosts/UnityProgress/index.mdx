## Hypatia 
Hello Everyone, I'm a programmer who loves video games and as of March 2021 I started making my own games and learning Unity. What is Hypatia you might ask? Well it's a game I've been working on since May 2021
and its a 2D action rpg, made with pixel art. Some features it includes is Greek Mythology, Ancient Athens, and skill trees, and philosophy. I want to make an exciting game that
users will have fun playing, but I also want people to learn along the way, that's why I'm making the game very accurate and drawing the scenes based on what it really looked like. 
I visited Athens, Greece in June 2021 and got a first hand look at what I'm dealing with. The Acropolis Museum helped me tremendously with creating models of the city at different points of time.
Although accuracy is very important to me, I have to twist the truth a bit to keep things interesting, thats why you might find some philosophers walking the same street that are from somewhat 
different generations! As of now I'm developing the art, programming and music all by myself but who knows what will change!

## Unity 
Some concepts I've ran into while learning unity, before this projects I haven't had too much experience with statically typed languages, I used mostly javascript and python, though I 
had one class in University on Java.


- Scriptable Objects
- Event System
- Singleton
