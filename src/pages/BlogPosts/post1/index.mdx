# The Frustration

Hello everyone and welcome to my humble little blog. This blog came out of a frustration, but I wasn't able to produce it because I didn't have the knowledge. So what was this frustration you may ask? I'll explain.
Do you ever use an application or visit a website and think, "Wow! How did they build this?", honestly it happens to me all the time, but I always added, I want to build this!

    -btw for those of you who really face this issue a lot, I would recommend a chrome extension called wappalyzer, it basically tells you what technologies sites are built with.

So I aim to solve this question and also take it a step furthur. I will tell you what technologies certain cites are built with **and** how each piece works. I am a software developer who likes to build everything from
the ground up myself. I always say I CAN DO IT MYSELF (Though I should probably ask for some help with UI design ðŸ™„). Anyways lets start on learning how to build things, with this website!

# How

So this website uses one Main technology, and like all big technologies, it's made up of little baby technologies. So this Technology is called React.
