## Daniel Shiffman

First and foremost I would like to say that I got the idea after reading Daniel Shifman's book _The Nature Of Code_ if you're into that kind of thing, I definitly
would urge you to check it out, its super interesting and your brain will be bursting with ideas of what to code gauranteed üëç. I'm writing this because in the
book he wrote the random walk in Processing which is a highly interactive programming language that is super fun and helps people learn and visualize and have
a lot of fun with code, but I really wanted to do it in Python so _here it is_

## Let's get started

So for this program all you'll need to have is Python, I will be using 3.9, but I'm sure 3+ should be good. We will be using 2 libraries that already come shipped
with python, turtle and random. So random is a library that generates random number (of course its not 100% random because it uses an algorithm but its good
enough for now). Turtle is a really nice visual library on python that is amazing for making shapes and drawing.

## Getting started

Open up you favorite python IDE and create a fresh new file, at the top you will
`import turtle.`
Now that we have access to the library we will
create our first turtle. so for simplicity I will name it t for turtle

```
t = turtle.Pen()
```

so from this turtle library I'm access a function Pen() that will create our turtle so that we can start drawing. So this Pen function can actually take parameters,
you can change the shap to a turtle by doing

```
t = turtle.Pen(shape="turtle")
```

or if you don't want any shape you can put

```
t = turtle.Pen(visible=False)
```

**Reminder capitilization is very important in code so make sure True has capital T and Pen has capital P**

alrighty so after you make your turtle variable when you now run the program a new window will pop up titled Python Turtle Graphics and there should be a shape unless
you put visible = to False

<img src={img1} alt="turtle varaible" />  

cool once you see that screen you can start playing around with your turtle, so let's start by making it move. So when we want to 
interact with our turtle we use the variable we created, in this case it t, so if I want t to move, I must give a *direction* and 
a *distance*. 
```
t.forward(100)
```
in this case the direction is forward and the distance is 100 pixels

after writing this when you run the program again you should see your little turtle pen draw a line, in my case 100 pixels long.  
Nice now that we got the technicalities out of the way, let's refer back to the random walk, which is our goal.  
  
## Getting a Random Number
First we are going to use the analogy of flipping a coin, when we flip a coin the outcomes can either be heads or tails. Since we are in the world
of programming its much easier to use numbers, so in this case we will be using 0 for heads and 1 for tails. in order to get a random number
we will use our random library so I want you to go to the top of your code and under where you imported turtle we are going to import random. It's
a really good practice to keep your imports at the top.  
  
once you've imported random let's use it to get a random number from 0 to 1. So in programming varaibles have a *type*, python makes
life easier because you don't need to say what type you want you just make a variable name and it gives you what you want. But in other 
language you need to say I want a number or I want a string (word), a number in programming is called an *integer* or int for short
so since we want a random number 0 to 1 we want a random int. in the random library we use the function randint which is short for
random integer, after that in the parameters for randint we need to say the range of the random number so from what number to what number, in 
this case its from 0 to 1
```
randomNumber = random.randint(0,1)
```
I just named the random number we get randomNumber, so if we want to see the randomness in action, lets make a looooong loop and print out the
result we get from this random number
```
for i in range(100000000000000):
   randomNumber = random.randint(0,1)
   print(randomNumber)
```
so when I ran ‚¨ÜÔ∏è code I got this.

<img alt="random numbers" src={random} />

so thats good, we are getting random numbers. Now lets hook this up to the turtle. The idea behind this is when we get heads or 0 the turtle
will go forward and when we get tails or 1 the turtle will go backward. For now one step will be 50 pixels. So let's add some logic. Once we add
the logic all the code should look like this 
```
import turtle
import random 

t= turtle.Pen()

for i in range(100000000000000):
    randomNumber = random.randint(0,1)
    if(randomNumber == 0):
        t.forward(50)
    elif(randomNumber == 1):
        t.backward(50)
```
