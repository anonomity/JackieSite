# Hypatia

Now I'm not gonna lie to you and talk about all the features I've implemented because I like to work on iteration. after each log the systems should gradually improve.
Plus the furthur along in the game I am, the more I know and the more I can optomize, so everything is in a pretty rudimentary form. I have downscoped the game in my head
which is something really important and something that creating those small projects have taught me. When I released the small projects, as soon as the release button was hit
I could hear the groan of the community complaining about something and some of these issues are extremely significant. For instance, with spider stalk I had to 
completely change how the main function was implemented. When you cast your web and get to the next leaf a timer goes off and the game engine is slowed down so you 
velocity is decreased. After tuning the difficulties, this worked fine on my machine and some other peoples machines, but on most it went so fast, they had 0 time to 
type the letters. I then had to do it differently and slow down the character using veloctiy. Imagine having little issues like that sprinkled accross all the features 
you've added to the game, it would be maddening. Again its easy to say something like "don't add too many features" but my pea size brain need to experience it in 
order to fully understand the consequences. 

so for now these are the systems we have been working on

1. Dialogue
2. Quests
3. Menu
4. Enemy / Entities
5. Combat
6. Boss 

## Dialogue

I'm using a plugin called Dialogic, that helps manage the a lot with a dialogue suff. I really love it in conjunction with the Signals in Godot and the Variables
and were able to get features in like quests.

### Quests
## Inventory

## New Pixel Art

## Enemy AI
