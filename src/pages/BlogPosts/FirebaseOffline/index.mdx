# Firebase

Firebase is a a collection of tools made by google. There's hosting, firestore, realtime database, analytics and I'm sure I'm missing more, but these are the tools I've used.

# The issue

I'm using firebase to store my data and redux to manage the in application state, the only problem with this, it that when the user looses internet, it looses contact with the server and its not able
to interact with the data. That is why I started looking into a way that I won't have this issue.
