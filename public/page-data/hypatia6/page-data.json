I have downscoped the game in my head\nwhich is something really important and something that creating those small projects have taught me. When I released the small projects, as soon as the release button was hit\nI could hear the groan of the community complaining about something and some of these issues are extremely significant. For instance, with spider stalk I had to\ncompletely change how the main function was implemented. When you cast your web and get to the next leaf a timer goes off and the game engine is slowed down so you\nvelocity is decreased. After tuning the difficulties, this worked fine on my machine and some other peoples machines, but on most it went so fast, they had 0 time to\ntype the letters. I then had to do it differently and slow down the character using veloctiy. Imagine having little issues like that sprinkled accross all the features\nyou've added to the game, it would be maddening.
